# CSS Git Gud Workshop

A virtual freedom wall in Java to demonstrate collaboration using Git!

## Overview

This a terminal program that renders a virtual freedom wall from a set of defined posts. The goal of the workshop is to have each participant create a simple pull request to add a new "post" to the repository. By the end of this workshop, we'll have a virtual freedom wall filled with just about anything that can be written, either with simple words or dynamic characters to the extent that you can program!

## How To

- STAR this repository (VERY important!!)
- Fork this repository
- Contribute either with:
  - Codespaces, hosted on GitHub
  - Your IDE of choice, on your local machine, by cloning the repo.
- Create a new branch and check out

  - `git checkout <name of branch>`
- Write your post!
- Commit and push your changes!
  - `git add .`
  - `git commit -m <your message>`
  - `git push origin <name of branch>`

- Hope we don't break this repo T_T
